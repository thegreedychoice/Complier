# Complier
This is a Class Project. No reuse allowed.

The project deals with development of a complete complier for a Haskell inspired language, and performs all necessary functions 
of a complier including scanning, parsing, semantic analysis, construction of an abstract syntax tree(for a defined set of attribute grammar),
type checking and immediate code generation. It is built for Java Environment(JVM).

The deign pattern used in this project is heavily inspired by Visitor Pattern as described in the book 
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by ErichGamma, RichardHelm, RalphJohnson, and JohnVlissides (the GangOfFour)
